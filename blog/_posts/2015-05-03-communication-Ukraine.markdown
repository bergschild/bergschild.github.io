<h2 class="section-heading"> 1. Communication with ordinary Russians </h2>

<p>Russians are being deluded about the true nature of the conflict. Even now a large porton of the Russian population don't realize that Russian military forces have been involved in the turmoil in the East Ukraine. At the same time, it is far from certain that if the Russians knew the true state of affairs, they would have will/strength to oppose it. Euphoria from territorial expansion is a strong drug to lull the sense of good and evil. Breaking this communication barrier and informing an average Russian of the true state of affairs could be the way for the US, EU and Ukraine to combat the propaganda of Putin's regime.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 2. Communication with ordinary Ukrainians </h2>

<p>Overly inflated expectations have been communicated to the Ukrainian public as to the prospects of EU future. At this point of time EU frankly wants nothing to do with Ukraine, which is a blackhole for any financial resources that may get transferred to it - due to corruption, economic troubles, surging military expenses etc. The realization of this fact by the Ukrainian public will lead to gross dissatisfaction with the current pro-Western political party, arouse sense of betrayal and will push Ukraine to select a cold political neutrality path in the longer term. A technocratic approach to governance would become the leading selling card for the next political election, in contrast to display of Western political sympathies, which is currently the main validity marker in public's eye.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 3. Communications with the EU </h2>

<p>Absence of consensus within the EU is another big one. The recent struggle EU countries have been having when attempting to coordinate their stance on Russia - that is, inability to coordinate a response against enemy - that feels like a really big omen for a political institution. Inability to communicate consensus indicates the inherent flaws in the design of the EU, and isn't that the communication failure at its best? At this point the divide on sanctions seems so wide that it might translate into other areas of EU cooperation - including economics, labor rules, immigration etc. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 4. Communication by the US </h2>

<p>The US has so far communicated sheer lack of certainty about what to do next (well, they do communicate this sense successfully, but I hesitate to call it a communication success). I have been lucky enough to witness a talk at Stanford, where the Director of Russian Policy with the US National Security Council projected the sense of being completely lost as to how to respond to Putin's actions - a mixture of anxiety of angrying him, fear of involving the US too much, and the paranoia of being left alone, should the EU decide Russia is more important to it economically and politically than Ukraine (which it is). While it is unlikely that the US is to become more active on the stage, at least, it could make an effort to take a stronger public stance on the issue.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">5. Communication in the world</h2>

<p>The most crucial failure, it seems, is the unanimous readiness of both the US and the EU to sacrifice libertarian values without hesitation should the price of protecting them be a war. While this might be the ugly truth, it is a failure to communicate this fact so transparently, as it weakens them significantly int he eyes of Russia, for which precisely the reverse seems to be true.</p>
